# FamilyBudget
This code reads multiple different points of data from the user and calculates the yearly budget for a family. At the end of the code, the program displays all the information in a neat fashion to show where families expenses are, savings, and other key information.

## How to run code
For this code to work, drag and drop the .java file into any java programming compiler, the code for us was written on a software called Eclipse.
And that's it! No really. That's it. Now all you gotta do is run the code, find a friend to play with and enjoy.
